Loads SSBM slippi replays into a sqlite db. Stores conversions as defined by the slippi-js parser.  

Search for and play conversion replays and then make playlists of your favorites.   

Record replays automatically with OBS websocket or (soon) native dolphin recording.  


TODO:
Refactor UI to use components/framework (react/vue/etc)  
Add option for choosing between OBS recording and dolphin framedumps  
Add option for gfycat uploading  
Add option for recordings of playlists to be split into different files  
More search options (search based on moves in conversion, etc)
